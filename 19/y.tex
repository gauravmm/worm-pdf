\blacklozenge  Topic:  What the Fuck Happened?
In:  Boards \blacktriangleright News \blacktriangleright Events \blacktrianglerightAmerica
Bagrat (Original Poster) (Veteran Member) (The Guy in the Know)
Posted on June 22nd, 2011:



I admit it.  I'm a cape geek.  You know it.  I know it.  I'm the cape geek the OTHER cape geeks go to for the crusty, juicy details on what's happening and where.  Look at my badges^.  I'm the guy in the know, and everyone on the News boards knows me.



Except I'm not in the know.  I've been calling in every contact I know, some CAPES, even.  I've been watching four different news channels and scouring the internet, and I'm CLUELESS.



Someone clue me in?  I'm desperate.  What the hell happened in Brockton Bay?



EDIT:  Board rules say I'm supposed to contribute something if I'm starting a thread, so here's what I do know.  Someone help fill in the blanks:



$\cdot$  June 18th:  Mayor Christner of Brockton Bay flies to Washington.  Makes argument against evacuation.  Surprises more than a few people.  At the same time, multiple Dragon suits are reported in the city.



$\cdot$  June 19th:  Explosion at Brockton Bay town hall, after supervillain Coil attempts coup and tinker equipment misfires in the ensuing skirmish.  Christner and Director Emily Piggot hospitalized and sent to ICU.  Thirty or more people reported dead, including Coil and subordinates \"{U}ber, Leet and Circus, and a number of field reporters.



$\cdot$  June 20th:  Massive deployment to Brockton Bay.  Unspecified class A threat.  Cape wives on the boards confirm: something's up.
Two hours later:  Threat level upgraded to class S.  All Protectorate capes who subscribed to the emergency response measure and accompanying pay increase now forced to get over to Brockton Bay and help.  Legend and Alexandria are among them.
We have a \underline{\strong{report}} (see link) from White Fairy, one of three more notable board members on the ground in Brockton Bay, who says they started establishing quarantine procedures around the site of the battle.



Cape wives on the boards report calls from their husbands and wives saying they're ok by about noon.  A few casualties, Myrddin among them.  No report on what happened and who the cape was on the opposing side.



$\cdot$  June 21st:  Almost a day later, capes start filtering home.  Still no reports.
Brocktonite03 (second of the three excellent people on the ground that are giving us reports) travels all the way out of town to get his hands on a working computer.  Reports Shatterbird attack and apparent quarantine procedures in the middle of an empty lot downtown.  White tent and beginning construction around it.



And then nothing.  Help me out!

The theory makes sense.  Huge clean up involving a hundred plus bodies, portal to another world, it would be something that they'd want to keep from the public, and you could even call it Class S if that world had capes of its own.  Which they'd have to, if they wanted to kill Myrddin.  Were we at war with another Earth on June 20th?

\blacktriangleright RobbyReplied on July 6th, 2011:
Two things:
1)  You don't need to censor yourself.
2)  Doesn't fit with what we know of alternate Earths. Breakdown of Haywire's research says we can't get to alt. Earths that are too close to our own.  Closest Earth to our own is Aleph, and deviation from that world started 30 years ago, the moment Scion arrived.  Anyone over 30 was born in both worlds, anyone under 30 wasn't, or the odds are almost impossible (same sperm, same egg, same time of conception required to have the same kid, and that's ignoring all the environmental influences during the pregnancy, and everything post-pregnancy that shapes the personality.)



\blacktriangleright TheGnatReplied on July 6th, 2011:
But Alexandria is over 30, isn't she?  It's not impossible they'd have a version of her.



\blacktriangleright RobbyReplied on July 6th, 2011:
With powers?  Improbable.
I doubt this alternate world we're talking about is exactly as far away as Earth Aleph, anyways.  I'd assume the point of deviation occurred more than thirty years ago, which lowers the chances even more.
In brief:  I doubt we have to worry about Endbringers and an evil Triumvirate.  This isn't the movies, and evil alternates are so overdone.

\blacklozenge  Topic:  The Ground Zero Badge
In:  Boards \blacktriangleright Places \blacktriangleright America \blacktrianglerightBrockton Bay \blacktrianglerightGround Zero (Private Board)
White Fairy (Veteran Member) (At Ground Zero: Brockton Bay)
Posted on June 31st, 2011:



I'm getting kind of fed up with this.  I talked about it with Alathea and Judge (the two original Brockton Bay board moderators) and Bagrat (major guy in the news section).  We got special dispensation to issue Brockton Bay Refugee and Ground Zero badges.  The goals were:
$\cdot$  It automatically give more weight to those of us who know more about what's going on in Brockton Bay, either because of our familiarity with the local capes or because we're \underline{there}.
$\cdot$  It's a way to get aid to people in trouble.  This was essential early on.  Someone's low on food or needs medical attention, the fact that they have a badge and that the badge is (presumably) validated means we can take a cry for help as something serious rather than a hoax.  (And for the record, I don't think a temporary ban is enough for the scumbags who faked cries for help â€“ in the early days, traveling across the city to deliver supplies was \underline{life threatening})
$\cdot$  It furthers the interests of Parahumans Online, to disseminate information and allow network among people in the right positions.  The badges let people know who can be contacted for more information or people we can coordinate with for certain tasks.  Case in point: Bagrat contacts Brocktonite03 about the incident a week and a half ago, Brocktonite03 goes and finds the quarantine tent and construction.  I can then contact Brocktonite03 and we organize a way to take turns visiting the construction site and then report progress to the boards, with picture progress so you guys can speculate or offer your own expertise.
$\cdot$  Filters access for getting onto the private board, so people in the prior two situations can manage



But there's \underline{certain} individuals who aren't using the system as it's meant to be used.  People got the badges with the loose verification system that existed in the early stages (and the mess of new moderators that came on board to manage the board), and they're using them for status or to put incorrect information or outright lies out there.  Alathea and Judge said they're willing to do a ban from this sub-board (and all related boards) if details can't be confirmed with further validation.  I'm talking to moderators of the main boards about maybe banning them from the site altogether.



So we're proposing further validation\ldots
$\cdot$  A photo of yourself at any construction in progress or recent piece of paperwork (flier, shelter pamphlet, whatever), with the date and your username prominently displayed.  Doesn't have to show your face, a photo of a hand with the details written on it, with the quarantine building in the background is perfect.
$\cdot$  I will \underline{meet} you.  Time and place of your choosing, though I'd prefer to meet you halfway if you're a ways away from the Towers, and I won't go into any of the danger zones.  If you need supplies, I have access to batteries, supply kits, gas and a car, and I will deliver it to you when we meet.  I might have luxury goods, but you'll have to pay for those.



There's a limited time window here, because the city's slowly coming together, and people are moving back in.
Edit:  Now that people are moving back in, we'll start banning people who weren't able to verify.  If you contact us and can explain why you weren't able to verify, that's ok (stay in hospital, no connection/power where you were at).  We'd like to meet you in person or see where you were staying for verification that you were in the city during the time of crisis.



We're going down the list.  The unconfirmed will be banned when verification stops being possible.



Confirmed:
$\cdot$  Chilldrizzle â€“ Met in person.  Delivered some fresh water and dog food.
$\cdot$  Morgan Sinister â€“ Met in person.  Brought chocolate, chocolate was paid for.
$\cdot$  Lo A Quest â€“ Met in person.  Talked for a few minutes, parted ways.
$\cdot$  Char â€“ Met in person.  Had the best meal I've had in weeks on the Boardwalk.
$\cdot$  bothad â€“ Photo verification
$\cdot$  Laser Augment â€“ Photo verification



Banned:
$\cdot$  Aku-42 â€“ Attempted to photoshop verification using an image Brocktonite03 already uploaded.
$\cdot$  Whackograve â€“ Admitted lie.



I know this sounds ridiculous, but we use systems like this for a reason.  It can mean life or death, even.

Your posting hours on the site suggest you've got something occupying your time from early in the day to evening.  Like maybe school?  Except there's no school in Brockton Bay yet (soon).  You state your location as the north end of Brockton Bay, profess to have a generator and satellite internet.  Ok, not unheard of.  Except you've apparently got enoguh gas stockpiled to keep the generator going 24/7 and, oh yeah, you're in \underline{Bitch's} territory!

You fuckers make me sick, like you can pretend to be all cool by being one of the survivors, who stuck it out through the Endbringer attack, the Nine and the gang wars.  But you left.  Your mommy and daddy took you out of town, and you're pretending you stuck it out, that you're here when you're not, all for a stupid internet badge and a peek at the private board.

Posted on June 26th:



Word's out, and we're waiting for the Protectorate to give a statement before we get further details.  Legend is stepping down, citing family reasons.  He's already on record saying that he intends to offer his aid in crisis events, but will no longer be leading the Protectorate.  His successor has not yet been named.

They haven't picked a successor yet because it's a little more complicated than picking the strongest hero.  They need someone who works on a number of levels, as a leader (both in terms of day to day paperwork and management and in the field), an ambassador (there's no less than 30 teams around the world that work with the Protectorate to some degree), a powerhouse (can't be weak or you won't be respected) and from a marketing standpoint.



\blacktriangleright Coyote-CReplied on July 6th, 2011:
@ Cowboy
Can't be Eidolon.  He's strong, but he's not a leader.  There's a ton of references to people meeting him at conventions or cape wives meeting him at functions.  I won't say he's an asshole, though some have said he rubbed them the wrong way, but people definitely don't walk away from meeting him with that universal ``Oh my god he's so nice!'' reaction that they have with Legend.



\blacktriangleright \strong{Mock Moniker}

Not to mention that there's rumors Alexandria or Eidolon might step down.  There's a lot of animosity being directed at them from certain groups.  Look at \strong{this} link and \strong{this} one.  The monsters in the Protectorate have almost all left.  Only one who stayed, I think, are Hunch and Polish.  I've been thinking it's another Bastion incident.  Someone higher-up says something racist or offensive, the Protectorate pulls strings to try and cover it up, but offended people are still offended.  Run off to make their own team.

For the record, I harbor no animosity toward the Protectorate.  We're still attached, and we're receiving equipment, funding and contacts through them.  They were very respectful as a whole, but we got a chance to interact a few weeks ago, and we collectively agreed that while the Protectorate's plan to build a rapport between us Case-53s (as the Protectorate terms us) and the public was sound (making me leader of the Brockton Bay Wards, for example), it was too slow, and we could do more as a group.

3 â€“ What the hell happened on the 20th?

Question â€“ just wondering.  Who's been leading the Protectorate since Legend left?

Speaking for someone in the thick of it all, I don't think that there's any expectation or assumption that recent events (losing Legend, losing Myrddin, several members leaving) will change the outcome of the next attack.  The Protectorate and immediately related teams only make up 25-50% of the defending side when outside of North America, and North America isn't a likely target.  There's been no policy changes or anything of the sort in the Protectorate that point to that degree of pessmism

If you wanted to go anywhere, and I agree with SeniorEel that you shouldn't go just because you're scared, apparently Brockton Bay is putting itself back together.

Copy pasting from one of my posts in another thread.  Current state of the villains in Brockton Bay:
$\cdot$  Skitter â€“ Boardwalk/North end.  Five stars, almost no crime, free food, work if you want it.  Water and power both.  Heard from a friend that stayed there for a while that he ran into some trouble, his place got raided, stuff taken.  Mentioned it to someone in passing, and the next day it's all returned, with some cash (two hundred dollars) and a note apologizing for the trouble, assuring him the matter was dealt with.  He left after that, which I don't get (free money).  Said he was creeped out.
$\cdot$  Parian â€“ Not a villain, but apparently struck a deal for a slice of territory at the very upper end of the city.  Not great, not bad.  Good spot to stay if you want a clear conscience and don't mind that the water and power aren't always on (80% of the time?) and shelters are a bit crowded.  Four and a half stars.
$\cdot$  Grue â€“ Western end of the city, from the docks to the lake downtown.  Almost a nonentity, but he's apparently dealt with some people who tried to set up shop.  Pick where you stay carefully, cuz there's areas with power and water, areas without, and it doesn't change much day to day.  Three stars.
$\cdot$  Imp â€“ Southernmost end of the city.  Shopping district, some of downtown.  There's a few dregs trying to set up shop with the no-name villain calling it her territory, and a few fights as a result (doesn't help that the big guns like Skitter are further away.)  I'd stay away from here because of that alone.
$\cdot$  Regent â€“ Eastern end of downtown.  Kind of a shantytown, area got hit hardest by the waves, shelter water and power nearly nonexistent, but the places that you can get are nice and very expensive.  Some violence bleeding over from Imp's territory.  Nothing here unless you're rich and want to live like a king among serfs.

Sorry to continue derailing thread, but Bitch apparently has a slice of the more remote areas, where you don't find many people living.  Captain's hill, the woods/hills, the beaches at the south that haven't been cleaned up yet.  Her gang's growing though, \underline{\strong{or so I hear}}.  Tattletale's not a fighter so it makes sense that she's more a behind the scenes person than one of the local warlords.  I think what Xylopop was saying was that the town's not so dangerous.  Probably more peaceful than it was at the start of the year, if you stay out of the very southernmost areas (and maybe the north â€“ I heard there's a few upstarts from New York and Boston trying to get a foothold there in Parian's area) and turn around if you hear a lot of barking.

My coworker and squad captain.  Went to school together, dropped out together, joined the PRT as grunt forces.  S9 got him, and as glad as I am he died fast, given what might have happened, doesn't change the fact that he's gone.  Loved him more than I love my wife, in a way.
Nc.

My aunt and uncle.  They were attacked by Chosen, dragged out of their homes and beaten.  My uncle fought back and smashed this one guy in the nose, and wrestled a gun from his hand, but got punched in the throat and dropped the gun.  He fought back some more, but eventually got knocked to the ground and shot.  I wasn't there, but I heard he went down like a hero.

My boyfriend.  He was in a shelter Leviathan attacked.  Only about half of us made it.  One of the heroes bailed us out.  Distracted the Endbringer and led him away.  Nc.
@Void_Cowboy: How do you know the story if you weren't there?

I'm not saying she's right\ldots  I'm saying she saved my life.  I get woken up by bugs.  Writing on the wall.  I go climb in the tub and *BAM*.  Glassplosion.

This conversation's going nowhere.  She's bad.  But she fought an Endbringer!  But that doesn't change the fact that she's bad.  But she saved lives!  But that doesn't change the fact that she's bad.  But she keeps the peace!
Aside:  Anyone else find it really funny that we're talking about Skitter being powerful like we used to talk about Kaiser and Lung?  If you'd told me the gawky bug girl was going to be one of the scariest motherfuckers in town, I wouldn't have believed you.

Easy to be one of the scariest people around if you're one of the only people around.  It's a question of surviving, and the Undersiders are the types who can get away from trouble, so they outlast the opposition.  How many capes are even left, now?

Makes you wonder what she's like in real life.  Who's the woman behind the mask (assuming woman from height)?  What's her day job?\strong{ }

She lives in the North end (apparently, first sighting, current location), slightly-above average height woman.  Slender.  Personality?  No idea.  What do we even know of her personality?



\sectionbreak



Greg stopped scrolling down the page.  The computer screen glowed in his dimly lit bedroom.



``A woman of above average height\ldots or a tall teenager,'' he mumbled to himself.  ``North end, lives in the area.  Personality\ldots vicious, smart, tough, a little unhinged?''



The image clicked.  A girl he'd had classes with, what felt like ages ago.  Taylor Hebert.



He'd thought maybe he had a shot with her, once.  Only she'd brushed him off.  It had bugged him more than it should have.  Why couldn't it be like it was in the movies and on TV?  Why couldn't the geeks band together?



He thought briefly of GstringGirl, felt a pang of disappointment and a momentary digust.  She'd refused the offer to meet up, then had turned down his request for a picture, or a webcam chat.  The conclusion had been obvious.  A creep.  A liar.



The name should have been a giveaway, but he'd held on to a shred of hope that there really was a girl out there more into gaming, coding and finding cool stuff on the web than on being `cool' and going out on Friday nights.



Was Taylor a creep of an entirely different sort?  A degenerate villain?  An \emph{upstanding} villain?  He could visualize her, sitting in class, tense with anger and frustration, the lines of her face hard as she bottled up a million little indignities and more than a few big ones.  It wasn't that hard to imagine.  Was Taylor \emph{Skitter}?



If he'd figured it out, others would too.  Or they would soon enough.  Her parents â€“ did they know?  They had to.  How could they \emph{not}?  Others.  Who else might have paid enough attention to Taylor to guess?  The girls who had been bullying her?  Maybe, maybe not.  Now that he'd thought about it, it was impossible to shake the idea.  But the bullies maybe didn't know the real her, didn't see the \emph{person}.



There was no way people wouldn't start connecting the dots.  Not with the eyes of the whole city, the whole \emph{country} on her.  Leader of a villain organization that had claimed a town and driven out all comers.  Ruthless, standing up against Endbringers and the Slaughterhouse Nine.



He wheeled his computer chair away from the desk.  His eyes fixed on the bulletin board to his left.  A poster for Ransack took up half of it, and other scraps of paper took up more space.  A checklist of unlocks to get for the game, the ad for the computer class he was taking, and in a space all on its own, an information sheet.  The remaining summer months would feature special arrangements for classes, to make up for the weeks of classes students had missed in the wake of the Endbringer attack.



The eighth of July.  Tomorrow.



Did she plan to go?  Was she aware of how much attention people were paying to her?



He could imagine himself in her shoes and could almost guess.  To actually have some confidence, after having none for so long?  To have a second chance?



In her shoes, he'd do it in a heartbeat.
